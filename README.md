# J2EE_Training
Basic J2EE applications examples. Knowledge in Java programming would be necessary to properly understand the examples,
but experience in other programming languages would be enough.

It contains:
- src package

    - A client-server application.
    - A RMI (Remote Method Invocation) calculator example.
    - A hard-code IP Address failure detector for ring structures.
    - A servlet that works on the web app, and just responds to the GET request. (ServletExample).
    - A more advance servlet example that includes the use of sessions, servlet context, and servlet initial configuration.

- web package:

    - A simple web app run on top of Tomcat 8.x server.

NOTE: I know that the code provided in these examples is not efficient.
They are merely examples to train yourself and understand J2EE.
